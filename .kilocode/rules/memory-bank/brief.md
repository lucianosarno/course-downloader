<Project Manifesto: Automated Video Course Downloader - START>

Project Title: OBS-Controlled Online Course Video Recorder

Core Objective: To automate the recording of online course videos from various platforms (e.g., Udemy, INE.com, Skillshare) using OBS Studio for personal use, enabling subsequent processing like transcription and flashcard creation.

Key Features & Capabilities:

text

Automated navigation to course pages and individual video links.
Extraction of video duration and essential metadata (course title, module, video title).
Programmatic control of OBS Studio (start/stop recording, set output timer) via WebSocket API.
Dynamic parsing of website structures using LLM-generated XPath maps.
Robust error handling, logging, and the ability to resume recordings from points of failure.
User confirmation of parsing maps and OBS settings for enhanced reliability.

Automation Scope: The system will fully automate the process of accessing a given course URL, listing all associated videos, navigating to each video page, extracting necessary information, and orchestrating OBS to record the content. Initial manual login to platforms will be required, but subsequent sessions will leverage pre-authenticated browser profiles.

User Interaction & Control:

text

User provides the initial course URL.
User performs the initial login to the course platform.
The system will present proposed parsing maps (generated by an LLM) for user review and confirmation before proceeding.
Key OBS recording settings will be displayed for user confirmation prior to beginning the recording process.
If a "play video" button or duration cannot be automatically identified, the system will prompt the user for guidance.

Output & Metadata: Recorded videos will be saved locally with a standardized naming convention: {domain}-{course-title}-{module}-{title}. Detailed logs will be generated for each video, regardless of recording success, to aid in troubleshooting.

Robustness & Error Handling:

text

Comprehensive logging will capture all operational details and errors, saved with the corresponding video filename.
The system will detect changes in website HTML structure upon re-processing a course and leverage LLMs to generate new parsing maps.
Ability to resume recording processes from the last successfully recorded video, skipping completed files and re-attempting failed ones.

Scalability & Performance: The system is designed to process one course at a time sequentially. It is expected to handle courses ranging from a few to dozens of videos, with the total process duration potentially equaling the sum of video durations, and is optimized for resilience rather than concurrent high-speed recording.

Technical Highlights:

text

Utilizes headless browser technology (Playwright/Selenium) for web interaction.
Communicates with OBS Studio via its WebSocket API.
Employs LLM APIs for dynamic generation of XPath-based parsing maps.
Manages project state and parsing rules using JSON files.
Developed primarily for Linux environments.

Ethical Consideration: This tool is intended strictly for personal use and for recording content to which the user has legitimate access, respecting copyright and platform terms of service.
